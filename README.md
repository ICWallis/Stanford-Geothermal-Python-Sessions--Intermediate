# Stanford Geothermal Python-Sessions -- Intermediate

## Workshop Outline

The purpose of this workshop is to expand participants knowledge of those elements of Python's language, libraries/packages, and the ecosystem that advances practical use of Python in geothermal science and engineering. 

The workshop is designed to be delivered in-person as a mix of lecture with the code contained in this repo. Therefore, this repo lacks the wrap-around documentation typical for a self-directed courses. Course content assumes participants already have a basic working knowledge of python.

## Setup Instructions

Participants attending this intermediate session directly after the beginner session can use the same environnement. We will demonstrate how to install other packages directly into that environnement. 

Participants attending only the intermediate session can either follow the setup instructions [here](https://github.com/ICWallis/Stanford-Geothermal-Python-Sessions--Beginner) or build an environnement from the requirements.yml in this repo.
