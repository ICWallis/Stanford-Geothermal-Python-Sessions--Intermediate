# Stanford Geothermal Python-Sessions -- Intermediate Advanced

## Workshop Outline

The purpose of this workshop is to expand participants knowledge of those elements of Python's libraries and ecosystem that will advance the practical use of Python in geothermal science and engineering. The workshop assumes participants are already familiar with the basic elements of the Python language. 

The workshop is designed to be delivered in-person and is a mix of lecture and the code examples contained in this repo.

# Setup Instructions

The workshop material is in Jupyter Notebooks and uses the packages listed in the environment.yml file. Feel free to use your preferred code editor (I will be using VS Studio Code during the workshop). If you are unfamiliar with Anaconda (conda) and setting up an environment, refer to the setup instructions in the [beginner workshop](). LINK NEEDED HERE

A binder instance of this repository can be accessed using the button below. You can edit and run the code in Binder, but you changes will not be saved. The first time you access the Binder instance, it can take up to 10 minutes to load. Click 'show' on the 'Build Logs' bar if you want to watch the Binder environment building.
