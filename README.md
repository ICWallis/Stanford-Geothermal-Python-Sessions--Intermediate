# Stanford Geothermal Python-Sessions -- Intermediate

## Workshop Outline

This workshop is designed expand participants knowledge of Python's language, libraries/packages, and ecosystem in ways that will advance the practical use of Python in geothermal science and engineering. 

Because this workshop is designed to be delivered in-person, it lacks the wrap-around documentation that is typical for a self-directed courses. The workshop assumes participants already have a basic working knowledge of python.

## Setup Instructions

Participants attending this intermediate session directly after the beginner session can use the same environment. I will demonstrate how to install other packages directly into that environment. 

Participants attending only the intermediate session can either follow the setup instructions [here](https://github.com/ICWallis/Stanford-Geothermal-Python-Sessions--Beginner) or build an environment from the requirements.yml in this repo.
