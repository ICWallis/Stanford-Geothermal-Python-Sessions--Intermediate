# Stanford Geothermal Python-Sessions -- Intermediate Advanced

## Overview
### Who, when, what


### Structure
The workshop is a mix of lecture and code-along using Jupyter Notebooks. 

## Pre-requites
Below is what I expect you to already know and have installed if you want to participate in the code-along portion of this workshop. You are welcome to attend if you do not meet these pre-requisites but, as this session is designed for intermediate and above, we will not be providing additional code-along support.
